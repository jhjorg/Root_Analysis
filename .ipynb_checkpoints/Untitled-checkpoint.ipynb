    "### A historical comparison of the dependence of the current England Cricket Team on Joe Root scoring runs\n",
    "\n",
    "At present (September 2021) Joe Root is in the form of his life. The remainder of the England batting line-up, however, is not. The conjecture is that this England Test side is more dependent on Joe Root scoring big runs than nearly any other side in modern cricketing history. A suggested comparison is the reliance of the late 1990's / early 2000's West Indies side on Brian Lara. But is this conjecture borne out in the data? This notebook analyses year-by-year Test batting statistics (appreciating this may not be the most appropriate temporal window available) to determine whether England really are Root(ed) without Joe."
